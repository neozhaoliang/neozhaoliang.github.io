  title        = {Lorentzian Coxeter systems and Boyd-Maxwell ball packings},
  abstract     = {In the recent study of infinite root systems, fractal patterns of ball packings were observed while visualizing roots in affine space. In this paper, we show that the observed fractals are exactly the ball packings described by Boyd and Maxwell. This correspondence is a corollary of a more fundamental result: Given a geometric representation of a Coxeter group in a Lorentz space, the set of limit directions of weights equals the set of limit roots. Additionally, we use Coxeter complexes to describe tangency graphs of the corresponding Boyd--Maxwell ball packings. Finally, we enumerate all the Coxeter systems that generate Boyd-Maxwell ball packings.},

From the citation on the occasion of the 2018 "Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition" It is almost impossible to write a mathematics book that can be read and enjoyed by peopleof all levels and backgrounds, yet Aigner and Ziegler accomplish this feat of exposition with virtuoso style. [] This book does an invaluable service to mathematics, by illustrating for non-mathematicians what it is that mathematicians mean when they speak about beauty. From the Reviews"... Inside PFTB (Proofs from The Book) is indeed a glimpse of mathematical heaven, where clever insights and beautiful ideas combine in astonishing and glorious ways. There is vast wealth within its pages, one gem after another. ... Aigner and Ziegler... write: "... all we offer is the examples that we have selected, hoping that our readers will share our enthusiasm about brilliant ideas, clever insights and wonderful observations." I do. ... "Notices of the AMS, August 1999"... This book is a pleasure to hold and to look at: ample margins, nice photos, instructive pictures and beautiful drawings ... It is a pleasure to read as well: the style is clear and entertaining, the level is close to elementary, the necessary background is given separately and the proofs are brilliant. ..."LMS Newsletter, January 1999" Martin Aigner and Gnter Ziegler succeeded admirably in putting together a broad collection of theorems and their proofs that would undoubtedly be in the Book of Erds. The theorems are so fundamental, their proofs so elegant and the remaining open questions so intriguing that every mathematician, regardless of speciality, can benefit from reading this book. ...
